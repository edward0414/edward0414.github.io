## About

I am Edward Feng, a passionate and curious second-year computer scientist at the University of Toronto. I enjoy building projects and learning about new technology and future trends. I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence and big data, and I am planning to delve deeper into these fields in the future. My goal is to use the skills I learn from each field to create applications that can improve people's everyday life.

In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing sports, finance investment, and exploring the nature. I am also the senior executive of a non-profit organization CACTES Associaiton, where I design and maintain its official website.

I am currently looking for a summer internship in a reputable place where I can utilize my skills and build my experience.
