## About

I am Edward Feng, a passionate and curious third-year computer scientist at the University of Toronto. For a while now I have been preparing for a career as a professional software developer through side projects and courses in computer science, such as databases and object-oriented programming. I particularly enjoy solving challenging problems and creating applications to automate tasks.

In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing sports, finance investment, and follwing the latest technology trends. In addition, I have done a few side projects, such as a full-stack web application and a mobile application using React Native. Check out my github account to learn more information.

I am currently looking for a summer internship in a reputable place where I can utilize my skills and build my experience.
