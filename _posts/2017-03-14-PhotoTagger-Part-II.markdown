Continue from part I of PhotoTagger.

Now, I needed to think of a design that is straight-forward and comfortable for the users. I decided to create multiple frames that allow users to choose directory, then images within the directory, and then tags to add.

The whole GUI is made of built-in JComponent of Java class.

Work in Progress...

You can check out the code on my [github page].
